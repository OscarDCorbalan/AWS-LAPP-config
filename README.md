# AWS-LAPP-config
LAPP (Linux, Apache, Python, Postgres) stack configuration for an Amazon AWS server

## Access data

The server is hosting https://github.com/OscarDoc/restaurants at:
  * http://52.26.206.3

Info for the reviewer:
  * IP: 52.26.206.3
  * SSH Port: 2200

## Configuration

### How to acess the server

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/account#!/development_environment)

Considering the private key is named udacity_key.rsa:

**Linux**:
  * Download private key for the AWS instance. 
  * Move the private key file into the folder ~/.ssh:
    * `$ mv ~/Downloads/udacity_key.rsa ~/.ssh/`
  * Set file rights (only owner can write and read.):
    * `$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa`
  * SSH into the instance:
    * `$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa root@PUPLIC-IP-ADDRESS`
 
Windows:
  * Download private key.
  * Use Puttygen to save the key in .ppk (Putty's) format.
  * Configure Putty to use the public IP of the server and the just created .ppk

### Create a sudoer user

[Course UD 229 - Configuring Linux Web Servers](https://www.udacity.com/course/configuring-linux-web-servers--ud299)

Logged in as `root`:
  * Create a new user named `grader`:
    * `sudo adduser grader`
    * Set a secret password
  * Give `grader` permission to sudo by editing Ubuntu's sudoers.d file as root:
    * `vi /etc/sudoers.d/grader`
    * Copy in the file: `grader ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
 
### Update all currently installed packages

[Course UD 229 - Configuring Linux Web Servers](https://www.udacity.com/course/configuring-linux-web-servers--ud299)

Run:
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get upgrade`
 
The first command will update package references, while the second actually updates packages.

### Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200

[Ask Ubuntu answer](http://askubuntu.com/a/16661)

  * `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * Change Port to 2200
    * Temporalily change PasswordAuthentication from no to yes, so `grader` can access until a key pair is generated.
    * At the end of the file, add `AllowUsers grader`.
  * Restart SSH:
    * `sudo service ssh restart`

**From now on**, your SSH connection has to be configured on **port 2200** and **use `grader`** to log in.

### Extra: Deny root's SSH

  * `$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * Change PermitRootLogin from without-password to no.


### Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)

### Configure the local timezone to UTC

### Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application

### Install and configure PostgreSQL:

### Do not allow remote connections

### Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database

### Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!


Your README.md file should include all of the following:
i. The IP address and SSH port so your server can be accessed by the reviewer.
ii. The complete URL to your hosted web application.
iii. A summary of software you installed and configuration changes made.
iv. A list of any third-party resources you made use of to complete this project.
